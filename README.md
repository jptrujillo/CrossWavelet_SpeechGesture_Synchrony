# CrossWavelet Speech-Gesture Synchrony Tutorial

This is a basic tutorial for applying cross-wavelet analysis to quantifying speech-gesture synchrony. The .html and markdown files provide some very basic theoretical explanation, 
as well as a worked example to quantifying synchrony and visualizing the results. This module is part of the ENVISION initative: https://envisionbox.org/
